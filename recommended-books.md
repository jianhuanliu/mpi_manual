Here are the books that helped me out the most when learning MPI. Most of these are written by the primary designers of the Message Passing Interface. Some also include tutorials on how to use OpenMP with MPI.

> **Disclaimer** - The last book is primarily a compilation of these tutorials by the original mpitutorial.com author (Wes Kendall).

## Parallel Programming with MPI
My personal favorite MPI book. The book gives a good overview of parallel computing before delving into all the various topics of MPI programming. It goes into detail about almost every essential MPI routine, and then it provides examples of parallel programs such as matrix multiplication and sorting. The end of the book discusses libraries and debugging routines.

## Using MPI - 3rd Edition
This is a more up-to-date book than the previous, but it mostly focuses on the newer and more advanced MPI routines in the third MPI standard. These include parallel I/O, remote memory access, and dynamic process management. The book also discusses using MPI with threads. This is a must have for advanced MPI development.

## Parallel Programming in C with MPI and OpenMP
This book is a bit older than the others, but it is still a classic. One strong point of this book is the huge amount of parallel programming examples, along with its focus on MPI and OpenMP. Many parallel programs are discussed in great detail, including matrix multiplication, fast fourier transforms, sorting, and combinatorial searching.

## MPI: The Complete Reference
A complete reference guide to MPI one and two. The book does not necessarily teach MPI, but it provides a great reference and complete descriptions of every single function. One advantage of this book is that it includes Fortran routines as well as C routines.
